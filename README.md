# WaterMonitoring_Online_IoT

This is a project deployed to monitor surface water quality, carried out in Vietnamese-German University (Viet Nam). It is, roughly, equivalent to a Bachelor thesis (in the field of Engineering and/or Computer Science and/or Information Technology). The code here is the fully comprised ("copy and paste", then re-adapted) of other github and website sources, some of which I may have forgotten where I have them from.

The criteria for measurements in this project include the following:
* pH
* Temperature
* TDS (Total dissolved solids)
* ORP (Oxidation - Reduction potential)
* Turbidity
* Electrical conductivity

The data, after collected, with be
* Send via text message
* Upload to an online server for futher processing and analysis (still stuck)
